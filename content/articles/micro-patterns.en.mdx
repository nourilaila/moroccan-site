## Micro Patterns: Tiny Tiles, Big Impact

Designers are embracing **micro‑pattern tiles** in 2025 to add depth and texture to bathrooms and kitchens.  Interior designer Erin Sander notes that "placing micro‑pattern tiles wall‑to‑wall provides depth and texture"【558337642969233†L328-L345】.  The small, repetitive patterns create a uniform backdrop for mirrors and fixtures that feels almost like a wallpaper【558337642969233†L341-L345】, making these tiny tiles a powerful tool in refined minimalist spaces.
