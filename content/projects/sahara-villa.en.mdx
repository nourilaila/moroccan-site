## Sahara Villa

Perched on the edge of the desert, the **Sahara Villa** celebrates the meeting of tradition and light.  Hand‑cut zellige tiles line the courtyard while sand‑blasted concrete forms gentle arches.  Brass fixtures and carved thuya wood doors add warmth and tactility.  The palette echoes the landscape: terracotta, olive and bone.
